## Party Slide Viewer
# JavaScript-ish fullscreen image viewer

I have been insensively looking for a lightweight partysystem that coould have been  
used at scene parties where I'm involved in organizing. As my needs are pretty basic,  
I just needed the viewer for slides that usually announce other demoscene events that are  
close in time. There were literally three options:

Partmeister - which is total mess, huge system depending on PHP knowledge and client/server  
              solution.
Wuhu - much lighter solution but still dependable on having at least local PHP server installed
Own system - which is basically this solution you're looking at. 

# What it does
- After entering images on click, it shows them in fullscreen mode (press F11 in your browser)  
in a loop.

# What it does not do
- There's no entry presentation system nor any kind of entry input (yet)

# How to use it
- open the html inyour browser
- click on the button and upload your image
- do it again for another images if you need them
- connect the screen output to the party beamer

# Will it improve?
- I don't know. Perhaps there will be some code refactoring to separate the shit out of the onefiler.

# What party is this for?
- Basically, for any party I'd need it in the future.

# Any other message?
- Amiiiiigaaaaaahh!!!!!111 .. and ZX Spectrum Forever :)
