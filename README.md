# Party Slide Viewer
## A rotation slides viewer for demoparties

## [Still WIP!]

I have been intensively looking for a lightweight partysystem that could have been  
used at scene parties I'm involved in organizing. As my needs are pretty basic,  
I just needed a rotation slide viewer usually announcing other demoscene events that are  
close in time. There were literally three options:

- Partymeister - huge system depending on PHP knowledge and client/server solution.
- Wuhu - much lighter solution but still dependable on having at least local PHP server installed
- Own ultra lightweight system - which is basically the solution you're looking at. 

## What it does
- After entering images on click, it shows them in fullscreen mode (press ``F11`` in your browser)  
in a rotation loop.
- You can press the ``M`` key to hide/show the control buttons
- You can press the ``F`` key to show/hide the list of image file names you have added
- When changing the rotation delay, restart the rotation
- When new slides added and the files box is visible, relaunch it (press ``F`` two times)

## What it does not do
- There's no entry presentation system nor any kind of entry input (yet)

## How to use it
- open the HTML file in your browser
- click on the button and upload your image
- do it again for another images if you need them
- adjust the interval (in seconds) to fit your needs by pressing the ``+`` and ``-`` button.
- [optional] connect the screen output to the party beamer
- press the ``Slideshow`` button and watch :)

## Will it improve?
- I don't know. Maybe.

## What party is this for?
- Basically, for any party I'd need it in the future where slide rotations are required.

## Pants off?
- Amiiiiigaaaaaahh!!!!!111 .. and ZX Spectrum Forever! :)
