## Party Slide Viewer
# JavaScript-ish fullscreen image viewer

## [Still WIP!]

I have been intensively looking for a lightweight partysystem that could have been  
used at scene parties I'm involved in organizing. As my needs are pretty basic,  
I just needed the viewer for slides usually announcing other demoscene events that are  
close in time. There were literally three options:

- Partymeister - huge system depending on PHP knowledge and client/server solution.
- Wuhu - much lighter solution but still dependable on having at least local PHP server installed
- Own ultra lightweight system - which is basically the solution you're looking at. 

# What it does
- After entering images on click, it shows them in fullscreen mode (press F11 in your browser)  
in a rotation loop.
- You can press the M key to hide/show the control buttons
- When changing the rotation delay, restart the rotation

# What it does not do
- There's no entry presentation system nor any kind of entry input (yet)

# How to use it
- open the HTML file in your browser
- click on the button and upload your image
- do it again for another images if you need them
- connect the screen output to the party beamer
- watch :)

# Will it improve?
- I don't know. Maybe.

# What party is this for?
- Basically, for any party I'd need it in the future.

# Pants off?
- Amiiiiigaaaaaahh!!!!!111 .. and ZX Spectrum Forever! :)
